# Extensions — recorded missing dependencies

Per `memory/no-placeholders.md`: when a feature cannot be implemented
because a real dependency is missing, the gap is recorded here rather
than left as a TODO or stub. Each entry names the call site, what is
needed, the workaround currently in tree, and which acceptance criterion
it unblocks.

## RESOLVED — I-Task-10 blocker #6: `frozen_leaves=` in MERA imag-time evolution

- Resolution: `mera_trotter_step`, `mera_imaginary_evolve_state`, and
  `mera_imaginary_evolve` (`src/qft_pcn/logic/mera_evolution_logic.py`)
  now accept `frozen_leaves: set[int] | None = None`. Inside
  `mera_trotter_step` the gate list returned by `ham.term_gates` is
  filtered to drop any gate whose target leaves intersect the frozen
  set BEFORE the per-leaf grouping pass — operator-algebraic restriction
  of H's action to the unfrozen subsystem (§5.2a / §8.6, "clamp +
  freeze"). For two-leaf gates with one frozen and one unfrozen leg the
  whole gate is dropped (the gate is not separable; the frozen leaf is
  a proved-lemma datum the lemma alone resolves). The default `None`
  preserves prior behavior bitwise — confirmed by the unchanged M2
  reduction / eval-Hamiltonian / fix-recursion suites (16 passed) and
  the broader evolution-touching tests (22 passed).
- Tests: `src/qft_pcn/tests/test_mera_evolution_logic.py` gains three
  cases (`test_trotter_step_with_all_leaves_frozen_is_identity`,
  `test_imaginary_evolve_many_steps_preserves_frozen_leaves`,
  `test_imaginary_evolve_descends_on_non_frozen_leaves`) — all-frozen
  identity, multi-step bitwise stability of a frozen subset, and
  monotone descent of the unfrozen subsystem when a PAD leaf is frozen.
- Unblocks: I-Task-10 two-stage acceptance (Promoter clamps lemma
  leaves and the relaxation driver must not deform them); J-Task-6
  wake-sleep (canonical primitives frozen during host relaxation);
  I-Task-10 blockers #5 (Forall-protected ground-state semantics
  reuses the same hook) and #1 (`relax_program` driver in M3).
- Per `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-23-i-task-10-blocker-fixes.md`
  blocker #6.

## RESOLVED — bridge RunResult does not surface MeraEncodingMeta / ground_state / solved_ast

- Resolution: `RunResult` now carries additive, default-`None` fields
  `meta`, `ground_state`, `solved_ast`, `hamiltonian`, and `trotter_steps`
  (`src/qft_pcn/bridge/runtime/result.py`). The MPS path in
  `bridge/runtime/__init__.py::run_problem` populates `ground_state` with
  the final relaxed `MPS`, `hamiltonian` with the composed
  `BridgeHamiltonian`, and `trotter_steps` with `search.steps`. The MPS
  path does not synthesise a `MeraEncodingMeta` or a decoded AST -- those
  remain `None` here and are the MERA-runner's responsibility (see the
  K-8 §10.10 path: a caller that owns `encode_mera`/`decode_mera` can
  populate the same fields end-to-end).
  `composition/dispatcher.py::run_child` reads the new fields via
  `getattr` and now wires through `bridge.runtime.run_problem` directly
  (previously imported a non-existent `run` symbol from
  `bridge.runtime.evolution`; the broken import was masked because every
  shipped dispatcher test used stub runners). A real-bridge integration
  test (`test_run_child_invokes_real_bridge_pipeline`) locks in the
  contract.
- Tests: `src/qft_pcn/tests/test_bridge_result_enrichment.py` (5 cases:
  legacy default, round-trip, end-to-end population, trotter-step
  fidelity, and the dispatcher's `getattr` access pattern) plus
  `src/qft_pcn/composition/tests/test_dispatcher.py::test_run_child_invokes_real_bridge_pipeline`.
- Unblocks: K-5 acceptance (real lemma registration on every solved
  child), §8.6 / §8.11 promotion acceptance via the dispatcher path,
  K-8 §10.10 acceptance.

## Missing dependency: bridge RunResult does not surface MeraEncodingMeta / ground_state / solved_ast (original entry, retained for history)

- Where: `src/qft_pcn/bridge/runtime/result.py` (RunResult dataclass) and
  `src/qft_pcn/composition/dispatcher.py:32-66` (`run_child`).
- Need: `RunResult` (or a sibling `RunArtifacts` it owns) should publish
  the live `MERA` ground state, the `MeraEncodingMeta` the run was
  decoded under, and the decoded `solved_ast`. `run_child` currently
  pulls these via `getattr(run_result, "ground_state", None)` etc., which
  always returns `None` against the shipped RunResult — so `ChildResult`
  arrives at the integrator with `meta=None` and `ground_state=None`,
  and `register_lemma` cannot be invoked.
- Workaround: `ChildResult` defaults `meta=None`/`hamiltonian=None`/
  `trotter_steps=0`; `integrate_child` refuses with a clear error
  ("child_result.meta missing: cannot register lemma") instead of
  silently bypassing the lemma path. A caller that constructs
  `ChildResult` from a richer runner can already populate these fields
  end-to-end (the new integrator tests do exactly this with
  `encode_mera`).
- Unblocks: K-5 acceptance (real lemma registration on every solved
  child), §8.6 / §8.11 promotion acceptance via the dispatcher path.

## Missing dependency: SubGoal.parent_site is a single int, not a leaf tuple

- Where: `src/qft_pcn/composition/goal_graph.py:36` (`SubGoal.parent_site:
  int | None`) and `result_integrator._resolve_host_leaves`.
- Need: a parent-aware decomposer that publishes the *full* host-leaf
  window the child lemma is meant to occupy, e.g. `parent_leaves:
  tuple[int, ...]`. The current single-int field underspecifies the
  clamp: lemma footprints span `n_leaves > 1` host sites.
- Workaround: `_resolve_host_leaves` extends `parent_site` to the
  contiguous window `[parent_site, parent_site + child_meta.n_leaves)`.
  This is the principled one-shot expansion for a child that decomposed
  out of an isomorphic parent region and is what the integrator tests
  exercise; a non-contiguous or species-permuted layout would need the
  richer SubGoal field.
- Unblocks: integrator's call to `Promoter.compile_constraint(... leaves=
  [...])` for non-trivial decomposers (J-Task / decomposer follow-on).

## Missing dependency: orchestrator does not own a parent MERA

- Where: `src/qft_pcn/composition/orchestrator.py:85-86` (`parent_state`,
  `parent_meta` default to `None`) and the resulting
  `integrate_child(None, None, ...)` call.
- Need: the orchestrator should own (or accept) a parent MERA + meta so
  every integrated child's lemma is genuinely clamped into the parent's
  tensor network -- the §6.1 acceptance.
- Workaround: `integrate_child` registers the lemma (real I-Task-7
  surface) and marks the node SOLVED, but skips the
  `Promoter.apply_init_clamp` step when `parent_state is None`. The
  orchestrator's existing tests rely on this graceful skip; promoting
  the orchestrator to own a parent MERA is its own follow-on.
- Unblocks: §6.1 / §8.6 end-to-end clamp via the orchestrator entry
  point (currently only exercised by the unit tests in
  `test_result_integrator.py`).
