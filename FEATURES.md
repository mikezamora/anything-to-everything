# Feature Ideas

- Better job management tools
- Resumable jobs (that save artifacts and checkpoints at the end of every step and track overrall progress) This is also a prerequisite to expanding to distributed processing on multiple instances of anything-to-everything workers
- Track on going job progress and output current step and job details

- Add Audiobook artwork to m4b files

- Add output explorer to view and download previous job outputs

- âœ… strip unknown tokens - **COMPLETED**

Automatically removes problematic tokens that cause TTS encoding issues while preserving normal punctuation (quotes, commas, periods). 

Previously caused warnings like:
```    
anything-to-everything  | >> Warning: input text contains 7 unknown tokens (id=2):      
anything-to-everything  |      Tokens which can't be encoded:  ['=', '=', '=', '=', '=', '=', '=']
```

**Implementation:**
- Enabled by default with `--strip-unknown-tokens` 
- Can be disabled with `--no-strip-unknown-tokens`
- Available in Web UI as "Strip Unknown Tokens" checkbox
- Removes: `= # * + ~ ^ @ $ % & | \ / < > [ ] { } _ ` `
- Preserves: `. , ! ? : ; " ' ( ) -`
